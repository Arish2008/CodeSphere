🛠️ BLOCKCHAIN WITH FLASK

A simple Python-based blockchain implementation using Flask. This project allows you to mine blocks, add transactions, and view the blockchain.

🚀 Features

Mining: Mine new blocks using proof-of-work.

Transactions: Add transactions to the blockchain.

Blockchain: View the entire blockchain.

📝 API Endpoints

1. Mine a New Block

To mine a new block, make a GET request to /mine. This will add a new block to the blockchain with a reward for the miner.

2. Add Transaction

To add a new transaction, make a POST request to /transactions/new. The request body should contain the sender, recipient, and the transaction amount. You can use Postman to send this request. This will create a new transaction and add it to the next block.

Example request body:

json

Copy code

{

  "sender": "sender_address",
 
  "recipient": "recipient_address",
 
  "amount": 10

}

3. View Blockchain

To view the entire blockchain, make a GET request to /chain. This will return the full chain of blocks along with their details.

🛠️ Proof of Work

The blockchain uses a proof-of-work mechanism to ensure security. Each block is validated by checking if its hash starts with four leading zeros ("0000"). This ensures that miners must perform computational work to add a new block to the blockchain.
